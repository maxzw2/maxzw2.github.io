## About Me

I'm a sophomore at Uni High taking the Programming Fundamentals course!

## My Project

For my final quest, I'll be attempting to complete the first 5 days of Advent of Code 2024, an Advent-style programming challenge. It's hosted yearly during December and features daily problems with two parts. These problems require different forms of data manipulation from a randomized input.

I'll be documenting my work, thought process, and other updates through blog posts on this website.
