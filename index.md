## About Me

I'm currently a student in the Programming Fundamentals course!

## My Project

For my final quest, I'll be attempting to complete the first 5 days of Advent of Code 2024, an Advent-style programming challenge. It's hosted yearly during December and features daily problems with two parts to them.

I'll be documenting my work, thought process, and other updates through blog posts on this website.
