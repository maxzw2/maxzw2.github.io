My most valued tip for new students learning programming fundamentals!

# My Advice: Take Your Time

My biggest tip for students aiming to learn programming fundamentals is to take your time with learning, especially with understanding why something works or does what it does. There’s an endless amount of information to learn out there – the most important part is to spend time doing it right. Understanding the inner workings and patterns behind programming, like the rules that syntax follows or why certain datatypes are used eases the learning process and can help prevent confusion when you’re overloaded with information. Taking time to gain conceptual understanding over pure memorization is crucial to go into depth in any topic, but especially for the systematic style of programming. Don’t feel rushed to try and figure out everything as fast as possible. You can only get true mastery through spaced-out repetition, so take your time and breathe. Store that comprehension in your memory!
