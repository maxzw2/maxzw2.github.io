Solving Advent of Code Day 3

Preparation:

Honestly, confidence is currently at an all-time low going into Day 3. After seeing the frustration I felt during Day 2, I know that something needs to change in my problem-solving process. My goal is to approach my coding process much slower -- check what my lines do as I write them instead of accidentally ending up down a rabbit hole path of errors. I'm hopeful to see if my process can be better for these sets of problems, especially since I plan on using a new module I haven't used before.

Debrief:

I successfully implemented regular expressions for Part 1, with only a few hiccups in the syntax the module requires. It was quite simple, following a similar pattern for Part 1's for other days as well. Part 2 was where I saw my active checking pay off. The problem now requires you to keep track of whether the pattern statement (multiplication, mul(X,Y)) is currently valid, based on whether there's a do() or don't() preceding it. I knew that I could focus on finding only the valid statements through using split(), but I initially tried splitting line by line. Because I tested, I knew that I was fudging the validity because the previous line didn't pass its validity to the next when iterating line by line. I was able to catch this slip-up early because I knew the properties thoroughly and checked as I went along. 

I successfully isolated the valid segments and yielded the correct answers for Day 3. I realized the importance of taking time to make sure your code is running how you want it. For example, I accidentally used a for loop when I switched over to read(), which converts the file into a string rather than a list, and I was able to catch that I was iterating by character in a string, not a list. 

I feel a lot better about tackling more problems, although I may not have enough time to complete the other 2 Days for Advent of Code. I found more about my habits with coding (accidentally skipping over impactful syntax details, staying rigid in trying to make one solution work) and what comes naturally to me in my patterns, like grouping tasks together. Overall, I enjoyed taking on this challenge of doing Advent of Code independently, especially since I was able to find information about regular expressions, as well as stumble on functools cmp_to_key for special sorting cases. I found that sort of "treasure hunting" within Python both difficult to comb through documentation while rewarding when you realize what you can do with all of these materials.

My next blog post will be the grand document for how I've been trying to test my code and make sure it covers cases, as well as how it's grown and changed over these problems.
