Solving Advent of Code Day 2

Preparation:

I felt confident about my ability to solve Day 2's problems, which seemed like a simple-ish integer difference problem. I was very comfortable with this, doing it various times as coursework and practicing it in other problems. My goal was to finish these problems swiftly and elegantly.

Debrief:

Solving Day 2 was a doozy. It took me multiple days of trying to figure out what was going on with my code for Part 2 -- figuring out which cases I was overcompensating for and which ones I was excluding when I made changes. 

I feel good about my solution to Part 1. I used the properties of sets to narrow down the complexity of my calculations, which made me feel confident with applying course knowledge to these problems. However, I faced multiple setbacks in implementing Part 2. The problem now is that you also have to find cases that would be valid if one integer was removed from the list. I had a general understanding of how to approach this problem -- go through cases with out-of-bound differences and comb through them. However, I didn't thoroughly examine my test cases, so I missed cases where the difference isn't out of bounds but is still valid. This was my first error, which plagued the rest of my attempts.

After a long bit of testing and examining my code by looking at each step I took, I couldn't figure out what cases I was overcompensating for. But this was because my "analysis" of my code was not very fine-tuned at all. I didn't account for all of the situations that my code would accept -- after writing down different scenarios for differences, I had found my problem. I approached it by looking purely at differences, while the problem cares about the integers behind those differences. I assumed that, after some brief testing, differences hold the same properties as taking out integers, so I lazily continued to try and make it work despite missing different scenarios. My mistake was trying to form a direct extension of Part 1 when in reality, they should be treated as two separate problems. My mindset was too rigid to try looking at the problem from a more complicated view that was needed.

At this point, I was feeling quite frustrated and tired of the problem -- I had felt that I could have been missing dozens more test cases. But, when I made the jump to switch over to removing integers from the list at the root of the problem, I ended up with the correct number of valid cases after playing around with it. Overall, I feel a little less moralized after this situation, but I know now the sort of challenges I will face in the future problems.

After diving into my code for Part 2, I am starting to fall under a near impossible time crunch to finish the other problems -- I will likely cut myself off after solving Day 3's problem. Time to learn about regular expressions for Day 3!
