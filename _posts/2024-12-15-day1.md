Solving Advent of Code Day 1

Preparation:

Going in, I felt very prepared to solve this day. We learned a lot about list manipulations and different operations we can use, so I felt confident because of my understanding of the topic. I didn't anticipate many setbacks for this day.

Debrief:

Solving part 1 was quite simple, a replication of my outline. I felt that my code was grounded and simple, which made me feel more comfortable with the problems.

Part 2 was almost a very similar application to part 1, instead of finding the frequency of numbers in one list for the other list. Because I had already gone through part 1, solving part 2 was quite simple, and I just converted my code to count the number of repeats. After solving Day 1, I feel a little more confident in solving the rest of the days after seeing my outline work out well.

I didn't face many challenges in solving Day 1. Onward to Day 2!
